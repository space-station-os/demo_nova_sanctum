### **Water Recovery System**
#### **Overview**
The **Water Recovery System (WRS)** is a critical subsystem of the **Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)** onboard the **International Space Station (ISS)**. The goal of this system is to **recycle wastewater** into **potable drinking water** for astronauts.

This project **simulates** the **water recovery process** using **ROS 2 nodes** representing different filtration, oxidation, and purification components.

---

## **Water Recovery System in Detail**
The **Water Recovery System (WRS)** consists of the following **major components**:

### **1. Waste & Hygiene Compartment (WHC)**
- The **starting point** of the system.
- Collects **crew urine and hygiene wastewater**.
- Mixes urine with **pretreatment chemicals** to prevent microbial growth.
- Sends **processed waste** to the **Waste Collection Node**.

### **2. Waste Collection System**
- Receives **wastewater from WHC**.
- Accumulates water **until a threshold is reached**.
- Sends **collected urine** to the **Urine Processor Assembly (UPA)** for purification.

### **3. Urine Processor Assembly (UPA)**
- **Distills urine** into **usable water**.
- Uses a **centrifugal vacuum distillation process**.
- Sends **cleaned water** to the **Filtration Unit**.

### **4. Filtration Unit**
- Removes **dissolved solids, organics, and ammonia**.
- Uses **Multifiltration (MF) beds**.
- Passes **filtered water** to the **Catalytic Chamber**.

### **5. Catalytic Chamber**
- **Oxidizes volatile organic compounds (VOCs)**.
- **Kills bacteria and microbes** using **heat & oxidation**.
- Sends **sterilized water** to the **Ionization Bed**.

### **6. Ionization Bed**
- Removes **remaining contaminants**.
- Adds **iodine** as a **biocide** to prevent microbial growth.
- Sends **final purified water** to the **Clean Water Tank**.

### **7. Product Water Tank**
- Stores **100 liters of clean drinking water**.
- Supplies water for **drinking, food rehydration, and hygiene**.
- Sends data to the **Oxygen Generation System (OGS)** for electrolysis.

## **Node Communication and Topics**
| **Node Name**        | **Incoming Data**                     | **Outgoing Data**                      | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| `whc`               | Crew urine input                     | Waste to `waste_collector`            | Collects urine & hygiene wastewater. |
| `waste_collector`   | Waste from `whc`                     | Processed waste to `upa`              | Stores wastewater and transfers it to UPA. |
| `upa`               | Wastewater from `waste_collector`     | Distillate water to `filter`          | Processes urine to extract water. |
| `filter`            | Distillate from `upa`                | Filtered water to `catalytic_chamber` | Removes organics, ammonia, and particulates. |
| `catalytic_chamber` | Water from `filter`                  | Oxidized water to `ionization`        | Sterilizes water and removes VOCs. |
| `ionization`        | Water from `catalytic_chamber`        | Purified water to `clean_water_tank`  | Final purification and iodine treatment. |
| `clean_water_tank`  | Clean water from `ionization`         | Dispensed water for crew, OGS system  | Stores potable water and sends data. |
